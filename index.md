## Currently

I am 4th year PhD student with an anticipated graduation date of Jun 2019. During my PhD, I have built several software packages for the analysis of high-speed video of nanoparticle diffusion. I have used these packages to explore many variables that affect the performance of nanotherapeutics in the brain microenvironment including particle-based parameters including size and surface functionality and regional differences within brain tissue.

### Research interests

Nanoparticle diffusion, image processing, particle tracking, machine learning
